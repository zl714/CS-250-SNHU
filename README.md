How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I figure out user needs by thinking about what the user wants to do with the program. I focus on their goals instead of just the technical parts. Writing user stories helps because it makes me see the program from the user's point of view, which keeps the work focused on what really matters.
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When building programs, I like to start small and add features a little at a time. I want to use Agile ideas like doing short sprints, having regular check-ins, and testing often. These practices help keep the project moving and make it easier to fix problems early.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means talking clearly, being respectful, and helping others when they need it. It’s important to share ideas, listen, and work together to solve problems as a team.
